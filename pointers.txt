Pointers

in function there are two calling conventions 


actual parameters and formal parameters

Call by value
are there 1st one is call by value method
here the values of actual parameters will be copied to formal parameters and these two different parameters store the values in different locations


Call by address
in this method during the function call address of the variable are passed as the function argument
2.any changes made in called function will reflect  in the calling function
in this method Pointers is used to store the address of the variable 


void fun(int *ptr1,int *ptr2){
    *ptr1=20;//this will be reflected outside the function also
    *ptt2=10;//this will be reflected outside the function also
}

Pointers  is a special kind of variable which stores the address of another variable.
by storing the address it points to a particular memory location. 
the general syntax for Pointers is datatype *ptr_variable;

* is known as indirection operator
